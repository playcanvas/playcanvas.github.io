    If false, all mesh instances in the scene are rendered by the camera, regardless of
    visibility. Defaults to false.
     * @property calculateTransform - Custom function you can
    provide to calculate the camera transformation matrix manually. Can be used for complex
    effects like reflections. Function is called using component's scope.
    Arguments:
    * {pc.Mat4} transformMatrix: output of the function.
    * {number} view: Type of view. Can be pc.VIEW_CENTER, pc.VIEW_LEFT or pc.VIEW_RIGHT.
    Left and right are only used in stereo rendering.

     * ElementComponents are used to construct user interfaces. An ElementComponent's [type](#type)
    property can be configured in 3 main ways: as a text element, as an image element or as a group element.
    If the ElementComponent has a {@link pc.ScreenComponent} ancestor in the hierarchy, it will be transformed
    with respect to the coordinate system of the screen. If there is no {@link pc.ScreenComponent} ancestor,
    the ElementComponent will be transformed like any other entity.
    
    You should never need to use the ElementComponent constructor. To add an ElementComponent to a {@link pc.Entity},
    use {@link pc.Entity#addComponent}:
    
    ~~~javascript
    // Add an element component to an entity with the default options
    let entity = pc.Entity();
    entity.addComponent("element"); // This defaults to a 'group' element
    ~~~
    
    To create a simple text-based element:
    
    ~~~javascript
    entity.addComponent("element", {
        anchor: new pc.Vec4(0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5), // centered anchor
        fontAsset: fontAsset,
        fontSize: 128,
        pivot: new pc.Vec2(0.5, 0.5),            // centered pivot
        text: "Hello World!",
        type: pc.ELEMENTTYPE_TEXT
    });
    ~~~
    
    Once the ElementComponent is added to the entity, you can set and get any of its properties:
    
    ~~~javascript
    entity.element.color = pc.Color.RED; // Set the element's color to red
    
    console.log(entity.element.color);   // Get the element's color and print it
    ~~~

     * @property type - The type of the ElementComponent. Can be:
    
    * {@link pc.ELEMENTTYPE_GROUP}: The component can be used as a layout mechanism to create groups of ElementComponents e.g. panels.
    * {@link pc.ELEMENTTYPE_IMAGE}: The component will render an image
    * {@link pc.ELEMENTTYPE_TEXT}: The component will render text
     * @property screen - The Entity with a {@link pc.ScreenComponent} that this component belongs to. This is automatically set when the component is a child of a ScreenComponent.
     * @property drawOrder - The draw order of the component. A higher value means that the component will be rendered on top of other components.
     * @property anchor - Specifies where the left, bottom, right and top edges of the component are anchored relative to its parent. Each value
    ranges from 0 to 1. E.g. a value of [0,0,0,0] means that the element will be anchored to the bottom left of its parent. A value of [1, 1, 1, 1] means
    it will be anchored to the top right. A split anchor is when the left-right or top-bottom pairs of the anchor are not equal. In that case the component will be resized to cover that entire area. E.g. a value of [0,0,1,1] will make the component resize exactly as its parent.

    * "point": A light that illuminates in all directions from a point.
    * "spot": A light that illuminates in all directions from a point and is bounded by a cone.
    Defaults to "directional".

    ignored. Defaults to white (1, 1, 1).
     * @property intensity - The brightness of the light. Defaults to 1.
     * @property castShadows - If enabled the light will cast shadows. Defaults to false.
     * @property shadowDistance - The distance from the viewpoint beyond which shadows
    are no longer rendered. Affects directional lights only. Defaults to 40.

    Intersecting multiple lights with bakeDir=true may lead to incorrect look of specular/bump-mapping in the area of intersection.
    The error is not always visible though, and highly scene-dependent.
     * @property shadowUpdateMode - Tells the renderer how often shadows must be updated for this light. Options:
    * {@link pc.SHADOWUPDATE_NONE}: Don't render shadows.

     * @property vsmBlurMode - Blurring mode for variance shadow maps:
    * {@link pc.BLUR_BOX}: Box filter.
    * {@link pc.BLUR_GAUSSIAN}: Gaussian filter. May look smoother than box, but requires more samples.
     * @property vsmBlurSize - Number of samples used for blurring a variance shadow map. Only uneven numbers work, even are incremented. Minimum value is 1, maximum is 25.
     * @property cookieAsset - Asset that has texture that will be assigned to cookie internally once asset resource is available.
     * @property cookie - Projection texture. Must be 2D for spot and cubemap for point (ignored if incorrect type is used).
     * @property cookieIntensity - Projection texture intensity (default is 1).
     * @property cookieFalloff - Toggle normal spotlight falloff when projection texture is used. When set to false, spotlight will work like a pure texture projector (only fading with distance). Default is false.

     * The Entity is the core primitive of a PlayCanvas game. Generally speaking an object in your game will consist of an {@link pc.Entity},
    and a set of {@link pc.Component}s which are managed by their respective {@link pc.ComponentSystem}s. One of those components maybe a
    {@link pc.ScriptComponent} which allows you to write custom code to attach to your Entity.
    <p>
    The Entity uniquely identifies the object and also provides a transform for position and orientation
    which it inherits from {@link pc.GraphNode} so can be added into the scene graph.
    The Component and ComponentSystem provide the logic to give an Entity a specific type of behavior. e.g. the ability to
    render a model or play a sound. Components are specific to an instance of an Entity and are attached (e.g. `this.entity.model`)
    ComponentSystems allow access to all Entities and Components and are attached to the {@link pc.Application}.
     * @example
     * var entity = new pc.Entity();
    
    // Add a Component to the Entity
    entity.addComponent("camera", {
        fov: 45,
        nearClip: 1,
        farClip: 10000

    // Add the Entity into the scene graph
    app.root.addChild(entity);
    
    // Move the entity
    entity.translate(10, 0, 0);
    
    // Or translate it by setting it's position directly
    var p = entity.getPosition();
    entity.setPosition(p.x + 10, p.y, p.z);
    
    // Change the entity's rotation in local space
    var e = entity.getLocalEulerAngles();
    entity.setLocalEulerAngles(e.x, e.y + 90, e.z);
    
    // Or use rotateLocal

     * This object allows you to configure and use the transform feedback feature (WebGL2
    only). How to use:
    
    1. First, check that you're on WebGL2, by looking at the `app.graphicsDevice.webgl2`` value.
    2. Define the outputs in your vertex shader. The syntax is `out vec3 out_vertex_position`,
    note that there must be out_ in the name. You can then simply assign values to these outputs
    in VS. The order and size of shader outputs must match the output buffer layout.
    3. Create the shader using `pc.TransformFeedback.createShader(device, vsCode, yourShaderName)`.
    4. Create/acquire the input vertex buffer. Can be any pc.VertexBuffer, either manually created,
    or from a pc.Mesh.
    5. Create the pc.TransformFeedback object: `var tf = new pc.TransformFeedback(inputBuffer)`.
    This object will internally create an output buffer.
    6. Run the shader: `tf.process(shader)`. Shader will take the input buffer, process it and
    write to the output buffer, then the input/output buffers will be automatically swapped, so
    you'll immediately see the result.
     * @example
     * // *** shader asset ***
    attribute vec3 vertex_position;
    attribute vec3 vertex_normal;
    attribute vec2 vertex_texCoord0;
    out vec3 out_vertex_position;
    out vec3 out_vertex_normal;
    out vec2 out_vertex_texCoord0;
    void main(void) {
        // read position and normal, write new position (push away)
        out_vertex_position = vertex_position + vertex_normal * 0.01;
        // pass other attributes unchanged
        out_vertex_normal = vertex_normal;
        out_vertex_texCoord0 = vertex_texCoord0;
    }
     * @example
     * // *** script asset ***
    var TransformExample = pc.createScript('transformExample');
    
    // attribute that references shader asset and material
    TransformExample.attributes.add('shaderCode', { type: 'asset', assetType: 'shader' });

    (see {@link pc.CameraComponent#calculateTransform} and {@link pc.CameraComponent#calculateProjection}).
    This function will receive camera index as the only argument. You can get the actual camera being used by looking up {@link pc.LayerComposition#cameras} with this index.
     * @property onPostCull - Custom function that is called after visibility culling is performed for this layer.
    Useful for reverting changes done in {@link pc.Layer#onPreCull} and determining final mesh instance visibility (see {@link pc.MeshInstance#visibleThisFrame}).
    This function will receive camera index as the only argument. You can get the actual camera being used by looking up {@link pc.LayerComposition#cameras} with this index.
     * @property onPreRender - Custom function that is called before this layer is rendered.
    Useful, for example, for reacting on screen size changes.

    Useful to revert changes made in {@link pc.Layer#onPreRender} or performing some processing on {@link pc.Layer#renderTarget}.
    This function is called after the last occurrence of this layer in {@link pc.LayerComposition}.
    It will receive camera index as the only argument. You can get the actual camera being used by looking up {@link pc.LayerComposition#cameras} with this index.
